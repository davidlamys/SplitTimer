# SplitTimer
An example of creating a split timer with RxSwift 

Inspired by Apple Timer and this article by Marin Todorov

This was a personal Kata as I thought it was 'simple' to build a split-laps-timer. I no longer think it's a trivial application.

TODO:
1: Cell model to encapsulate the strings.
2: Highlight quickest lap in green.
3: Highlight slowest lap in red.
