# SplitTimer
An example of creating a split timer with RxSwift 

Inspired by Apple Timer and this article by Marin Todorov

http://rx-marin.com/post/rxswift-rxcocoa-sample-split-laps-timer/

This was a personal Kata as I thought it was 'simple' to build a split-laps-timer. I no longer think it's a trivial application.

TODO:
1. Replace Cocoapods with Carthage
2. Integrate Rome
3. Try XCodeGen
4. Try Bazel (it's an over kill but it's something I have been meaning to try.)
